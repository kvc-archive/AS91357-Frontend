                <p>A practical investigation is an activity covering the complete investigation process: planning and carrying out the investigation, collecting primary data, processing and interpreting data, and reporting on the investigation. Students may make changes to their initial method as they work through the investigation.</p><br>
                <p>Assessment against this standard may be based on a stand-alone or an individual investigation that can contribute findings to a larger group or class investigation.  In a group or class investigation, individual findings may be discussed and individual students may interpret their own findings in the light of other students' investigations and findings.  Findings from outside the group or class such as published information or historical findings relevant to the investigation may also be used.</p><br>

                <p>It is intended that this investigation be carried out with supervision.  This means that the teacher provides guidelines for the investigation such as the context for the investigation, instructions that specify the requirements for a comprehensive investigation, and broad experimental conditions such as the availability of equipment or chemicals.  Students then develop and complete the investigation from the initial guidelines given by the teacher.  Supervision may involve discussion between teachers and individual students in order to clarify the students' ideas and may also involve teachers managing the process of sharing findings.</p><br>

                <p>A biological drawing follows the accepted conventions to record observations consistent with the biological material being viewed.  Consistency of observations with the biological material used must include recognisable shape and proportions and inclusion of typical organelles present in a cell, appropriate to the magnification.  At the Achieved grade, the biological drawing may contain some errors in applying conventions or minor inaccuracies in representation.  At the Merit grade the biological drawing may contain some minor errors as long as they do not affect the accuracy of the representation of the biological material being viewed.</p><br>
                <p>Specialised features may include: arrangement of cells or cell types within a tissue, shape of a cell, presence or absence of a specific organelle, quantity or distribution of organelles within a cell.  Notes about the specialised features may accompany the biological drawing (eg a fully annotated diagram).</p><br>
