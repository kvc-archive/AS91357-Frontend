            <h3>Biology 2.6 | Investigate a pattern in an ecological community, with supervision</h3>
            <p><strong>Level:</strong> 2
            <p><strong>Credits:</strong> 4
            <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Internal<br>
            
            <p>This achievement standard involves the investigation of a pattern in an ecological community, with supervision.
            
            <h1>Achievement Criteria</h1>
            
            <h2>Achievement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigate a pattern in an ecological community, with supervision.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Achievement with Merit</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigate in-depth a pattern in an ecological community, with supervision</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Achievement with Excellence</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comprehensively investigate a pattern in an ecological community, with supervision.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h1>Explanatory Notes</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Explore ecological distribution patterns and explain possible causes for these patterns</li>
                    <li>Investigate involves describing observations or findings, and using those findings to identify the pattern (or absence of a pattern) in an ecological community, relating this pattern to an environmental factor, and describing how the environmental factor might affect chosen species within the community.</li>
                    <li>Investigate in-depth involves providing a reason for how or why the biology of one of the chosen species relates to the pattern (or absence of a pattern).  The biology involves structural, behavioural or physiological adaptations of the organism which are related to the environmental factor and to an interrelationship with an organism of another species (eg competition, predation, or mutualism).</li>
                    <li>Investigate comprehensively involves using an environmental factor and the biology of interrelated organisms of different species to explain the pattern (or absence of a pattern).  The explanation may involve elaborating, applying, justifying, relating, evaluating, comparing and contrasting, and analysing.</li>
                    <li>Investigation involves analysing, and interpreting information about the ecosystem.  The information may come from direct observations, collection of field data, tables, graphs, resource sheets, photographs, videos, websites, and/or reference texts.</li>
                    <li>A community pattern may include: succession, zonation, stratification, or another distribution pattern in response to an environmental factor.</li>
                    <li>Environmental factors likely to affect patterns in a community include abiotic and/or biotic factors.</li>
                    <li>Biology of the organisms refers to any adaptations of organisms that relate to the pattern being investigated and may include interrelationships such as competition, predation, or mutualism.</li>
                    <li>Assessment against this standard may be based on a stand-alone or an individual investigation that can contribute findings to a larger group or class investigation.  In a group or class investigation, individual findings may be discussed and individual students may interpret their own findings in the light of other students' investigations and findings.  Findings from outside the group or class such as published information or historical findings relevant to the investigation may also be used.</li>
                    <li>It is intended that this investigation be carried out with supervision.  This means that the teacher provides guidelines for the investigation such as the context for the investigation, instructions that specify the requirements for a comprehensive investigation, and broad conditions such as the availability of equipment and/or resource material.  Students then develop and complete the investigation from the initial guidelines given by the teacher.  Supervision may involve discussion between teachers and individual students in order to clarify the students' ideas and may also involve teachers managing the process of sharing findings.</li>
                    <li>Conditions of Assessment related to this achievement standard can be found at http://ncea.tki.org.nz/Resources-for-Internally-Assessed-Achievement-Standards.</li>
