            <h3>What is biology?
            <br>
            <p2>How can there be seedless grapes and bananas, and how do they reproduce? 
                Where did we come from? Why is carbon monoxide extremely poisonous? 
                Why can't you tickle yourself? What causes the smell after rain? 
                How do vitamins work? What's all this fuss about stem cells? 
                What makes us yawn? Why are frogs growing extra legs out of their legs? 
                Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Biology is the study of living things and their vital processes. 
                Because biology covers such a large area, it has been traditional to separate the study of plants (botany) 
                from that of animals (zoology), and the study of structure of organisms (morphology) from that of function 
                (physiology). 
                Despite their apparent differences, all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles, 
                so current practice tends to investigate those biological phenomena that all living things have in common. 
                The advancement of knowledge and technology has resulted in further categorizations that include, 
                but are far from restricted to: cell biology, population biology, ecology, genetics, biochemistry, 
                molecular biology, microbiology, agriculture and physical anthropology.
