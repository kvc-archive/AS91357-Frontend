            <h3>Biology 2.3 | Demonstrate understanding of adaptation of plants or animals to their way of life</h3>
            <p><strong>Level:</strong> 2
            <p><strong>Credits:</strong> 3
            <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Internal<br>
            
            <p>This achievement standard involves demonstrating understanding of adaptation of plants or animals to their way of life.

            <h1>Achievement Criteria</h1>
            
            <h2>Achievement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demonstrate understanding of adaptation of plants or animals to their way of life.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Achievement with Merit</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demonstrate in-depth understanding of adaptation of plants or animals to their way of life.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Achievement with Excellence</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demonstrate comprehensive understanding of adaptation of plants or animals to their way of life.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h1>Explanatory Notes</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Demonstrate understanding involves describing the adaptations and identifying the aspects of the adaptations that enable each organism to carry out its life process(es) in order to survive in its habitat.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate in-depth understanding involves providing a biological reason that explains how or why the adaptations enable each organism to carry out its life process(es) in order to survive in its habitat.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate comprehensive understanding involves showing understanding by linking several biological ideas.  The linking of ideas may involve justifying, evaluating, comparing and contrasting, or analysing, and must include consideration of the two points from below appropriate to the chosen context.<br>
                    In the context of understanding of adaptation related to one life process over three taxonomic or functional groups of multi-cellular plants or animals:
                        <ul>
                            <li>comparing diversity of adaptation in response to the same demand across different taxonomic or functional groups</li>
                            <li>limitations and advantages involved in each feature within each organism</li>
                        </ul>
                    In the context of understanding of adaptation across two related life processes within one taxonomic or functional group:
                        <ul>
                            <li>connections between two life processes within each organism which enhance the effectiveness of both processes</li>
                            <li>limitations and advantages involved in each feature within each organism.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Understanding of adaptation is demonstrated in relation to one life process over three taxonomic or functional groups of multi-cellular plants or animals, or across two related life processes within one taxonomic or functional group.</li>
                    <li>Adaptation involves the range of ways in which organisms have developed strategies to carry out the life processes.  An adaptation refers to a feature and its function as it enables an organism to carry out a life process and thus occupy a specific ecological niche.  It may include structural, behavioural, or physiological features of an organism.  An adaptation provides an advantage for the organism in its specific habitat and ecological niche.</li>
                    <li>Way of life encompasses the ways in which an organism carries out all its life processes.  It includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>relationships with other organisms - competition, predation, parasitism, mutualism</li>
                            <li>reproductive strategies</li>
                            <li>adaptations to the physical habitat.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Life processes are selected from:
                        <ul>
                            <li>internal transport</li>
                            <li>gas exchange</li>
                            <li>transpiration</li>
                            <li>nutrition</li>
                            <li>excretion</li>
                            <li>support and movement</li>
                            <li>sensitivity and co-ordination</li>
                            <li>reproduction.</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
