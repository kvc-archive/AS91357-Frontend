            <p>Welcome to 200 Biology. The website is non-profit, so if you can help out in any way, shape or form then please send me a message. This resource initially was used for students for homework and revision. if a link is dead or you would like an image/file/ link removed and I will sort it as soon as I can. Anyone can search Google but the real skill is finding that what is relevant and work on understanding concepts, not just learning key word lists.
